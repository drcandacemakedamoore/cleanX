## Prerequisites
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- a [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation
- ability to create virtual environments

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by command:

``` sh
python setup.py apidoc
python setup.py build_sphinx
```

The documentation will be generated in `./build/sphinx/html` directory. Documentation
is under revision.

##ABOUT USING THIS LIBRARY:
If you use the library, please credit me and my collaborators.  You are only free to use this library according to license. The GLP license implies you should be open sourcing your entire code base, and sending me modifications.  You can get in touch with me by email (doctormakeda@gmail.com) if you have a legitamate reason to use my library without open-sourcing your code base,or following other conditions, and I can make you specifically a different license.

This is the beta+ version. Some unit tests are availalable in the test folder. Test coverage is currently partial. The library includes several functions including: 


Ones to run on dataframes to make sure there is no image leakage: 

check_paths_for_group_leakage(train_df, test_df, uniqueID):

    """
    Args:
        train_df (dataframe): dataframe describing train dataset
        test_df (dataframe): dataframe describing test dataset
        uniqueID (str): string name of column with image ID, patient IDs or some other unique ID that is in all dfs
    
    Returns:
        pics_in_both_groups: duplications of any image into both sets as a new dataframe
    """
    
    
One to run on single images, one at a time, if you want to crop off a black frame:

        image: an image 
    
    Returns:

    """
    
crop(image):

        image: an image 
    
    Returns:
        image[np.min(y_nonzero):np.max(y_nonzero), np.min(x_nonzero):np.max(x_nonzero)]: image cropped of black edges

    Args:
        
        set_of_images: a list
