ABOUT USING THIS LIBRARY:
If you use the library, please credit me and my collaborators.  You are only free to use this library according to license. The GLP license implies you should be open sourcing your entire code base, and sending me modifications.  You can get in touch with me by email (doctormakeda@gmail.com) if you have a legitamate reason to use my library without open-sourcing your code base,or following other conditions, and I can make you specifically a different license.

This is the beta+ version. Some unit tests are availalable in the test folder. Test coverage is currently partial. The library includes several functions including: 


Ones to run on dataframes to make sure there is no image leakage: 

check_paths_for_group_leakage(train_df, test_df, uniqueID):

    """
    Args:
        train_df (dataframe): dataframe describing train dataset
        test_df (dataframe): dataframe describing test dataset
        uniqueID (str): string name of column with image ID, patient IDs or some other unique ID that is in all dfs
    
    Returns:
        pics_in_both_groups: duplications of any image into both sets as a new dataframe
    """
    
    
One to run on single images, one at a time, if you want to crop off a black frame:

simpler_crop(image):

     """
    Args:
        
        image: an image 
    
    Returns:
        image[np.min(y_nonzero):np.max(y_nonzero), np.min(x_nonzero):np.max(x_nonzero)]: image cropped of black edges
    """
    
crop(image):

     """
    NB: expanded from simpler crop to handle for PIl and nonPIl types of JPEGS
    Args:
        
        image: an image 
    
    Returns:
        image[np.min(y_nonzero):np.max(y_nonzero), np.min(x_nonzero):np.max(x_nonzero)]: image cropped of black edges
    """
       
One to run on a list to make a prototype tiny Xray others can be comapared to: 


seperate_image_averger(set_of_images, s=5 ):

    """
    Args:
        
        set_of_images: a list 
        s: number of pixels for height and wifth
    
    Returns:
        canvas/len(set_of_images): an average tiny image (can feed another function which compares to this mini)
    """
    
Many to run on image files which are inside a folder to check if they are "clean"

augment_and_move(origin_folder, target_folder, transformations):
    
    """
    Args:
        origin_folder: folder with 'virgin' images
        target_folder: folder to drop images after transformations
        transformations : example tranformations = [ImageOps.mirror, ImageOps.flip]...some function to transform the image

        technically not a return but puts augmented images into a new folder
    """

crop_them_all(origin_folder, target_folder):

    """
