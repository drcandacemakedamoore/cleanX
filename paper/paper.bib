abstract = {Applying data mining and machine learning algorithms requires many steps to prepare data and to make use of modeling results. This study investigates two questions: (1) how time consuming are the pre- and post-processing steps? (2) how much research energy is spent on these steps? To answer these questions I surveyed practitioners about their experiences in applying modeling techniques and categorized data mining and machine learning research papers from 2009 according to the modeling step(s) they addressed. Survey results show that model building consumes only 14% of the time spent on a typical project; the remaining time is spent on pre- and post-processing steps. Both survey responses and the categorization of research papers show that data mining and machine learning researchers spend the majority of their energy on algorithms for constructing models and significantly less energy on other steps. These findings collectively suggest that there are research opportunities to simplify the steps that precede and follow model building.},

abstract = {The vast amount of data produced by today’s medical imaging systems has led medical professionals to turn to novel technologies in order to efficiently handle their data and exploit the rich information present in them. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as one of the most prominent solutions, promising to revolutionise every day clinical practice and medical research. The pillar supporting the development of reliable and robust AI algorithms is the appropriate preparation of the medical images to be used by the AI-driven solutions. Here, we provide a comprehensive guide for the necessary steps to prepare medical images prior to developing or applying AI algorithms. The main steps involved in a typical medical image preparation pipeline include: (i) image acquisition at clinical sites, (ii) image de-identification to remove personal information and protect patient privacy, (iii) data curation to control for image and associated information quality, (iv) image storage, and (v) image annotation. There exists a plethora of open access tools to perform each of the aforementioned tasks and are hereby reviewed. Furthermore, we detail medical image repositories covering different organs and diseases. Such repositories are constantly increasing and enriched with the advent of big data. Lastly, we offer directions for future work in this rapidly evolving field.}
