cleanX documentation
========================

Here is some general information about the package. We are working on
documentation for programmers and medical professionals with some coding
experience. 
The package helps with data cleaning for two-dimensional medical images. The
idea is that given files of images, you can use the functions as APIs to build
the basis for machine learning algorithms. You can use the code to clean out
data that would lower the quality of your algorithm,
and use the code to add augmented images.


The API Documentation / Guide

If you are looking for information on a specific function, class, or method,
this part of the documentation is for you.
