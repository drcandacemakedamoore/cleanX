cleanX documentation
========================

Here is some general information about the cleanX package. We are working on
documentation for programmers and medical professionals with some coding
experience. 
The package helps with data cleaning for two-dimensional medical images. The
idea is that given DICOMs or files of images, you can use the functions as APIs
to build the basis for machine learning or certain other types of algorithms.
You can use the package code to clean out data that would lower the quality of
your algorithm, and use the code to add augmented images.
